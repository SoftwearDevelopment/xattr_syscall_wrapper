# xattr_syscall_wrapper

Wrappers for the syscalls getxattr, setxattr, removexattr and listxattr.

## Motivation

There are `attr` and `getfattr`/`setfattr` which are standard parts of linux.
Unfortunately they seem to do a lot of checking for the caller, to the effect
that only `getfattr` as capable of reading `system.cifs_acl` and neither attr
nor `setfattr` where able to write it again. The same (probably) goes for other
system xattrs.

This repository provides plain wrappers around the syscalls and does zero extra
checks; the caller is responsible for encoding/decoding the data provided on
stdin/stdout and for choosing the correct namespace for the data.

Using these raw wrappers we can easily migrate windows acls between mounts (and posix
ACL as well probably and other cool things):

```
cp /mnt1/file /mnt2/file
getxattr /mnt1/file system.cifs_acl | setxattr /mnt2/file system.cifs_acl
```

## Building/Installing

```
[CXX=g++] make
sudo [prefix=/usr/local] make install
```

## Examples

Dumping the value of each xattr:

```
#! /bin/bash

set -e

listxattr -z "$1" | while IFS= read -r -d '' attr; do
  echo -n "$attr: "
  getxattr "$1" "$attr"
  echo
done
```

Copying all xattrs from one file to another:

```
#! /bin/bash

set -e

from="$1"
to="$2"

# Optionally purge all data on the dest file
listxattr -z "$to" | while IFS= read -r -d '' attr; do
  removexattr "$to" "$attr"
done

# Copy The Data
listxattr -z "$from" | while IFS= read -r -d '' attr; do
  getxattr "$from" "$attr" | setxattr "$to" "$attr"
done
```
